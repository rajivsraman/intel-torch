# AIPI 590 (Applied Computer Vision) - Project 1
### Author: Rajiv Raman
### Institution: Duke University
### Date: April 1st, 2025

## Overview

The project task was to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can predict at least 5 different types of "scenes" given an input image. This repository features the code, the results, and the demo involved with building a modified VGG16-based CNN using transfer learning with an MLP classifier.
