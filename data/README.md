This folder contains the data (for training, validation, and prediction) taken from the Intel Image Classification dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/data). Due to certain limitations with file size, only a subset of each of these three datasets has been uploaded to the repository. To pull the full dataset, visit the Kaggle website and download the data there, then rename and restructure the directories as I have done in this repository.
