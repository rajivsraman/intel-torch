This folder is intended to host the data (for training, validation, and prediction) taken from the Intel Image Classification dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/data). Due to the large size of the dataset, I have not included most of the images in this repository - only a subset of the predictions dataset is used for the Streamlit demo.
