This folder is intended to host the data (for training, validation, and prediction) taken from the Intel Image Classification dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/data). Due to the large size of the dataset, I have not included most of the images in this repository - only a subset of the predictions dataset is used for the Streamlit demo. To pull the full dataset, download the zip file from the Kaggle link, and extract the contents such that three folders (seg_train, seg_test, and seg_pred) are all in the data folder.
